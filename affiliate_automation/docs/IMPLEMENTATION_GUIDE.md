    "growth_rate": "8.20% annually",
    "top_programs": [
        "masterclass",
        "teachable",
        "udemy",
        "coursera",
        "skillshare"
    ],
    "commission_rates": {
        "masterclass": "25%",
        "teachable": "30%",
        "udemy": "15%",
        "coursera": "20%",
        "skillshare": "10%"
    },
    "content_types": [
        "course_reviews",
        "learning_path_guides",
        "skill_comparison"
    ],
    "keywords": [
        "best online courses",
        "learn programming",
        "digital skills",
        "certification courses"
    ]
}
```

## Usage

### Running the Full Workflow

To run the complete affiliate marketing automation workflow:

```bash
python main.py --niche online_learning
```

This will execute the following steps:
1. Research the online learning niche
2. Create a website structure
3. Generate content for the website
4. Set up marketing campaigns
5. Track performance and optimize strategies

### Running Specific Modes

You can run specific parts of the workflow using the `--mode` parameter:

```bash
# Run only niche research
python main.py --niche online_learning --mode research

# Run only content generation
python main.py --niche online_learning --mode content

# Run only website creation
python main.py --niche online_learning --mode website --domain your-domain.com

# Run only marketing automation
python main.py --niche online_learning --mode marketing
```

### Using the Run Script

For convenience, you can use the provided shell script:

```bash
./run.sh --niche online_learning --mode full
```

## Component Details

### Affiliate Agent

The Affiliate Agent (`agent/affiliate_agent.py`) is the main orchestrator that manages the entire workflow. It initializes with a specified niche and executes the workflow through a series of methods:

```python
agent = AffiliateAgent(niche="online_learning")
agent.run_workflow()
```

### Content Generator

The Content Generator (`agent/content_generator.py`) creates high-quality, SEO-optimized content for affiliate marketing. It supports various article types:

```python
content_generator = ContentGenerator(niche="online_learning")
article = content_generator.generate_article(
    article_type="product_review",
    topic="Best Online Learning Platforms"
)
```

### Website Generator

The Website Generator (`agent/website_generator.py`) creates and manages affiliate websites:

```python
website_generator = WebsiteGenerator(niche="online_learning")
website = website_generator.create_website(
    domain_name="online-learning-guide.com",
    template="affiliate_blog"
)
```

### Marketing Automation

The Marketing Automation module (`agent/marketing_automation.py`) handles social media and email marketing campaigns:

```python
marketing_automation = MarketingAutomation(niche="online_learning")
social_campaign = marketing_automation.create_social_media_campaign(
    content_title="The Ultimate Online Learning Guide",
    platforms=["pinterest", "instagram", "twitter", "facebook"]
)
```

## Performance Tracking and Optimization

The system includes built-in performance tracking and optimization capabilities:

```python
# Track performance
performance = marketing_automation.track_performance()

# Optimize campaigns
optimized_campaigns = marketing_automation.optimize_campaigns(performance)
```

## Saving and Loading State

You can save and load the agent state to resume operations:

```python
# Save state
agent.save_state("/path/to/state.json")

# Load state
agent = AffiliateAgent.load_state("/path/to/state.json")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Research**: Always begin by researching the most profitable niches
2. **Focus on Quality Content**: High-quality, valuable content is essential for success
3. **Diversify Marketing Channels**: Use multiple marketing channels for better results
4. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly check performance metrics and optimize
5. **Stay Ethical**: Always follow ethical affiliate marketing practices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Issues**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is correctly set in the environment variables
2. **Import Errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Configuration Errors**: Check that your niche is correctly defined in the configuration file

### Logging

The system uses Python's logging module to log operations. Log files are stored in the `logs/` directory:

```
logs/
├── affiliate_agent.log
├── content_generator.log
├── website_generator.log
└── marketing_automation.log
```

## Extending the System

The system is designed to be easily extensible:

1. **Adding New Niches**: Add new niches to the `AFFILIATE_NICHES` dictionary in `config/config.py`
2. **Custom Content Types**: Add new content types to the `content_types` list for each niche
3. **New Marketing Channels**: Extend the `MarketingAutomation` class to support new channels

## Conclusion

The AI-Powered Affiliate Marketing Automation System provides a comprehensive solution for automating affiliate marketing activities. By following this implementation guide, you can set up and use the system to build a profitable affiliate marketing business with minimal manual intervention.
